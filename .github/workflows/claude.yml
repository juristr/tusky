            Use your CI/CD tools to:
            1. Get workflow run details and download failed job logs
            2. Analyze root cause of failure
            3. Examine relevant source code
            4. Propose specific fix with reasoning

            IMPORTANT: Do NOT make code changes or create commits. Only provide analysis and recommendations in your comment:
            - Root cause
            - Proposed solution with code examples
            - Why fix will work
